# New Alley Group

## "Have Pride in Where We Live"

We are back and ready to keep our area litter-free and beautiful!  
The New Alley Group is all about neighbors coming together once a month to prevent fly tipping and make our community a better place to live.

### A Message from the Founder

I'm 81 years young and excited to restart this group!  
I used to run this group and it really worked, but now I need younger people to help with the work.  
I'll provide the tea, coffee, and biscuits, handle the admin, and keep everyone on their toes!
